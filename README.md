# Unciv-Updater
A simple tool which automatically updates Unciv (https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) to its latest version.

# How to actually use the tool

when you run it, it tells you the latest version of unciv, then you can download the zip of it without having to go to the github

When the .zip is installed, simply "Extract to /Unciv"
The Linux Version includes an extractor, which you run after downloading the zip. All saves are kept

it also downloads the changelog, so that's cool too if you want to read what changes happened
# How do I compile this??

Install AutoHotKey at https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ and click "Download Autohotkey Installer"

Go to its installation directory --> Compiler --> Ahk2Exe.exe to compile the Updater
